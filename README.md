üè° Project Overview: House Price Prediction Model

As part of my ongoing work in machine learning and data science, I‚Äôve developed a House Price Prediction Model aimed at predicting the price of properties based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. This model provides a practical solution for real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions.

What I did:

Data Collection: I gathered data from real estate platforms containing information on property prices, locations, square footage, number of rooms, and other relevant features.
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: The data was pre-processed to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. Feature engineering was done to improve model prediction accuracy.
Model Building: I applied regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.) to build a predictive model. The model was trained and tested using historical property data.
Model Evaluation: I evaluated model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R¬≤) to ensure high prediction accuracy.
Key Takeaways:

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems, especially in the real estate sector.
The predictive model can assist in determining property values, helping buyers, sellers, and agents make more informed decisions.
I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing my journey in machine learning and exploring how predictive models can transform industries.

Feel free to connect or share your thoughts on this project. I'd love to discuss how machine learning is shaping the future of real estate!
